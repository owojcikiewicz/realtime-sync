### Real-time Sync
Real-time Sync enables collaborative editing of HTML inputs in real-time across multiple websites and clients. The project is built using WebSockets and can - in principle - support an unlimited amount of websites with multiple elements. This was initially built as a recruitment task for an unnamed company.
